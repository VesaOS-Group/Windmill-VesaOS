# Windmill - VesaOS Version
An interpreted binary executor for VesaOS.


TODO (Things marked with (VesaOS) are VesaOS specific):
- Parsing methods - only byte & int32 to string atm;
- If statements;
- Goto function;
- Memory shifting/gc;
- *Multitasking*;
- Graphics and window support (VesaOS)
- A way to tell if you are running on VesaOS (VesaOS)

Note: The current project files are made for a normal CLI C# application, but they can easily be ported over to CosmosOS.
